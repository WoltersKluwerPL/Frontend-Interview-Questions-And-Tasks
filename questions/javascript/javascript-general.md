JavaScript General
==================

## Must have

* What is the difference between local variables and global and how are they defined?
* What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
* What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
* What is the difference between `call` and `apply`?
* What is `strict mode`?
* How you are debugging JavaScript code?
* What is `scope` (in `ES5`)?
* `prototype` - what is it and what for is it? 
* `this` and its operation in the JS. Please, discuss briefly.

## Nice to have

* Imagine that you have a table with `1000` lines. You have a task to each row of the table, react to mouse clicks and perform some action. How do you do it effectively?
* What is the `event bubbling`?
* What is `hoisting`?
* What are the `closures`?
* `JSLint` / `JSHint` / `ESLint`? Or maybe not worth it? :)
* Are you able to tell a little bit about `ES6` (ECMAScript 2015)?
* Expansion / overwrite `native method`. How?
* What frameworks / libraries do you know? Which do you use?
